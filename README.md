DOG VS CAT CLASSIFIER USING CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORKS


->First, I imported a dataset from kaggle containing several images of dogs and cats.

->Then I used generators to separate the dataset into training and validation dataset.

->Then I made a sequential cnn model having various convolutional and pooling layers

->After that I compiled the model using adam optimizer.

->Then I trained my model till 10epochs which gave me a training accuracy of 97% and a validation accuracy of 79%.
