**DOG VS CAT CLASSIFIER USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK(CNN)🐶😺**


->First, I imported a dataset from kaggle containing several images of dogs and cats.

->Then I used generators to separate the dataset into training and validation dataset.

->Then I made a sequential cnn model having various convolutional and pooling layers.

->After that I compiled the model using adam optimizer.

->Then I trained my model till 10epochs which gave me a training accuracy of 97% and a validation accuracy of 79%.

->Then I drew the training vs validation graph to check any overfitting in my model.

->Then I took any sample image from my kaggle dataset and predicted it using my model.
